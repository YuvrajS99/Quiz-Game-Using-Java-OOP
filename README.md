## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Questions class stores question details (id, question, options, answer).
2. QuestionService class contains:
   - An array of Questions objects
   - Logic to display questions
   - Logic to take input and store answers
   - Logic to calculate and print the score
3. Main class runs the quiz by calling:
   - playQuiz()
   - printScore()
